This project applies network analysis (graph theory) to two case studies:
- Bitcoin transactions (2009â€“2013): decentralized structure, liquidity flows, concentration, and resilience.
- Madoff fraud: Ponzi scheme topology, systemic fragility, centrality of intermediaries, and lack of redundancy.

## Content
- Python code for data processing and network analysis (NetworkX, Pandas, Matplotlib).
- Metrics: degree, betweenness, eigenvector centrality, k-core, modularity, resilience, path efficiency.
- Graph visualizations and community detection.
- PDF report summarizing the results.

## Relevance
- Comprehensive application of network analysis methods to real-world cases.
- Comparison of two radically different structures (decentralized system vs centralized system).
- Illustration of key notions such as flow concentration, resilience, and modularity.

## Limitations
- Project completed during the third year of a bachelor's degree, with limited computational resources.
- Use of reduced samples for Bitcoin due to performance constraints, which may affect the accuracy of some measures.
- Limited visualization of the full Bitcoin network because of its size.
